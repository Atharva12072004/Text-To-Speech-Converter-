# Text-To-Speech-Converter-
A Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter is a technology that transforms written text into spoken words. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and voice synthesis, TTS reads text aloud in a human-like voice. This tool is especially beneficial for visually impaired users, language learners, and multitaskers who need audio access to information.
